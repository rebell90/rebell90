# 👋 Hi there, I'm Becca Bell

Welcome! I'm a software developer focused on building thoughtful, useful tools that solve real-world problems — whether it's helping businesses run smoother, supporting my family, or creating something just for fun.

## 💻 About Me

I specialize in backend development and automation, with deep expertise in:

- 🔹 **Oracle APEX** for scalable low-code enterprise apps
- 🔹 **SQL / PL/SQL**, **JavaScript**, and API integrations
- 🔹 Designing efficient databases and workflow-driven tools
- 🔹 Building purposeful, user-first software — fast

I love turning complex workflows into elegant, efficient apps. I’m also exploring ways to use GPT and automation in everyday life — especially in support of ADHD, executive function, and family organization.

## 🚀 Goals & Learning Path

- 🎯 Grow into a **Solutions Architect** or **Startup Tech Lead** role
- 🧠 Master modern backend stacks (FastAPI, Go, Node.js)
- 🐳 Build and scale with **Docker**, **Redis**, and **Kubernetes**
- ☕️ Learn **Java** and **Swift** to expand my app-building toolkit
- 🔗 Explore GPT-powered tools for ADHD, education, and productivity

## 🧩 Current Projects

### 🔗 URL Shortener (Monolith → Microservices)
> FastAPI + PostgreSQL app  
> REST API, retry logic, Dockerized stack  
> Currently evolving toward microservices with async queueing and rate limiting

### 🚚 Delivery Dispatch App *(Oracle APEX, In Progress)*
> Lightweight dispatch system with:
- Route & driver assignment
- Approval layers and task scheduling
- Role-based access and mobile-ready forms

### 🧠 FocusFlow *(Coming Soon)*
> Oracle APEX task/routine builder for ADHD support  
> REST-enabled timers, visual cues, daily routine tracking

### 💰 PennyTrail *(Coming Soon)*
> Family expense and budget tracker  
> Categorized spend logs, savings goals, ADHD-friendly views

## 🧬 Data Science Projects (R / Python)

Before specializing in backend development, I worked in **data science**, especially in **bioinformatics** and **marketing analytics**.

### 🧪 Notable Repos
- 🧬 `Transcriptome_COVID_Control_GSE176480`: GEO data on COVID9
- 🔍 `scRNASeq_COVID19`: Single cell RNA Seq on COVID data
- 📊 `Juvenile_Arthritis_RNAseq`: GEO Data analyzing Juvenile Arthritis (pursued this project trying to understand my daughter's diagnosis - around 2020)

These projects shaped my love for automation, clean data flows, and repeatable analysis — which eventually led me to full-stack dev.
